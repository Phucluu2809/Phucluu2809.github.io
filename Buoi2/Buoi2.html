        </b>
        For real
    </p>
    <h2>
        <p><b>Styling?</b></p>
    </h2>
    <p>You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span
            style="color: brown">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some award to put on your damn
        footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
    <p>Well, guess what, you're <span style="color:brown"><u>WRONG</u></span>, motherfucker.</p>
    <p><b>
            <h1>The best kick-ass website</h1>
        </b></p>
    <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span
            style="color:brown">motherfuckingwebsites:</span>></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Home Page</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)
        </li>
        <li>
            Looks almost the same on every screen
        </li>
        <li>
            Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span style="font-size:5px">well, kind of</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span style="font-size:5px;">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without
            looking like an <a href="https://www.google.com">ARPANET</a> website
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://www.google.com">IPoAC</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans"<span style="font-size:5px;"> which btw weighs
                15.21kB, wtf</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any
            other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't include any tracking service
        </li>
        <li>
            Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use some fucking colors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when
            they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.google.com">nice color</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><h1><b>Well guess what, motherfucker:</b></h1></p>
    <p>This website is even better than the last <span style ="color: brown">g<u>u</u>y</span> and <span style ="color: brown"><u>guy before him</u></span></p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's over a secure connection - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses one of the most general gTLDs available out there: .website
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out domainr to do something cool too.
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses the kickass Let's Encrypt CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses a custom version of the awesome ultra-lightweight jQuery /s
        </li>
        <li>
            It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated they will notice and maybe they will switch from the crap they use to a much cooler browser
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript JavaScript logo, CSS3 CSS3 logo and HTML5 HTML5 Logo
        </li>
        <li>
            Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered
        </li>
        <li>
            It supports HTTP/2
        </li>I
        <li>
            It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once
        </li>
        <li>
            It allows universal access from every website via CORS
        </li>
        <li>
            It is Accessible
        </li>
        <li>
            It is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it almost free to keep this website alive
        </li>
        <li>
            It's Open Source, freely available on GitHub, and everybody can contribute to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                It uses the WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
                <br>
                <br>
                0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
